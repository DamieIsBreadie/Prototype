        So! I added a little corner to test out features or any interesting ideas I may have! Helpful little thing that's for sure, <br> 
        gotta find a way to make it prettier! Oh! I also added a little navbar, although there's not much on it, I am planning to add <br> 
        more pages in the future! Maybe I will add more ideas throughout the day. We shall see! >:D</p>

        <h2 class="title">Post 1: Starting a progress blog! (Idk how to name things lol)</h1>
        <p class="content">
        Hello all! I'm trying to create, design and host my own blog which basically is <br>
        just tiny updates on my coding progress! Or maybe some tiny snippets of my own thoughts! My writing skills <br>
        have gotten worse as well so this might be a nice spot to improve it! I am currently typing the paragraph through my IDE, <br> 
        though I am not sure if I am doing this correctly. Regardless, I will learn as I go! The pages I have set up will most likely <br> 
        have changes over time, and I mean a lot of changes. Thanks for reading! <br> <br> 
        
        Sidenote: I just discovered that the 'br' tag is used to enter a new line as opposed to '/n'! </p>
